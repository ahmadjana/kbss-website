# *Collecting meaningful data: an iterative approach*
### Presenter: Miroslav Blasko
Even sophisticated systems often produce hardly reusable data or data with questionable quality. The reason is that the expected
meaning of gathered data is not adequately communicated to users. We address this problem by novel domain-driven development methodology
based on early and continuous prototyping of ontology-driven form-based user interface. Through iterations, the meaning of form questions is con-
tinuously improved and integrated into the evolving software product. Semantic documentation of data management is used to make refactor-
ing and respective data migration more meaningful and efficient. The methodology builds upon research of domain level and upper-level on-
tologies. We present the methodology on two use cases from aviation-
safety and medical domain.
