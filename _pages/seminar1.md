# *Domain-specific Semantic Web-based Information Systems - Any Progress?*
### Presenter: Martin Ledvinka 
Information systems with complex domain logic could tremendously benefit from incorporating Semantic Web technologies and principles, be it globally relevant identifiers, Linked Data, or expressive reasoning to name just a few. While some of the Semantic Web principles may be applied on top of regular information systems backed by relational databases, others are better suited for becoming an integral part of the system itself. In this paper, we analyze the main reasons why the Semantic Web has been used so sparsely in such applications. We also discuss architectural and design implications of the choice to build a domain-specific information system based on Semantic Web technologies. This discussion is complemented by a case study comparing the development of a safety data collecting and processing system using both Semantic Web and more traditional technologies.
Our experience with building several domain-specific Semantic Web-based information systems is presented in the end as well.
